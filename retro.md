Essentially the basic jist of a retrospect is to have a meeting where everyone involved in the project gets a possibility
to get their voice heard about what they think about the project so far. Everyone can make good observations, encouraging 
the same kind of procedure in the future, or bad observations about things that should maybe be worked on, or completely removed
from the scope. 
There are several ways to do this, but the essence of it stays the same. There is an facilitator that organizes and documents the comments
of the group, and the group gives feedback based on the types of questions and topics the facilitator asks for. 
Afterwards then the group then reads through all the gathered comments, and reflects over what they agree and disagree on. This enables
the group to see what kind of issues they all share, and even though some of them may not directly relate to the project, it might 
be something worth attempting to fix. For example if many people see that the dark, wet depressing weather outside is making them tired
and broken, maybe it could be fixed by natural light lamps, and a coffee machine.
